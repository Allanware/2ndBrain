峰哥访问一对深山男女：https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RN411v7o1
我觉得有很多有道理，有所共鸣的话：
- 人的内心的平静在于找到一个平衡点：女主从上山前批判现代社会的种种（人际关系，与自然的疏离) 到体会到下山就能洗热水澡的幸福，也不再一味批判现代社会。同时她之前也批判农村生活，比如为什么农村家里都挺脏的，随便扔塑料瓶；她亲身经历后发现很难不脏。这种平衡来源于她的经历。缺乏这种平衡，会让人无所适从，不知何处为家。这种平衡带来了内心
- 不实践得不出这些感悟
- （预防）妈宝的形成：妈妈要在小时候就让孩子探索，去认知去独立（只有独立了才能对事物有责任感），长大了就很难改了
- 女主体会过一个女人在没有电的情况下带孩子的艰辛，能理解了以前女性无法独立的原因，而现代文明解放了女性。但现代社会也使得男女互补的需求大大降低
- 如果一有事情和内心所认定的相违背就性格大变，这是不成熟的表现

3Blue1Brown: [What "Follow Your Dreams" Misses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3I3kAg2J7w)
"Follow your dreams" first assumes you have a dream, and stick to it. What if you have no dream, and even if you do, do you have to stick to it?

Under the assumption that you want to be influential because:
- the primary goal in society is to add values to others: in school, many institutions around you and yourself is working towards the sole goal of getting yourself better (it serves as the end to itself, self-centered); but outside school, the goal shifts: personal skill is still useful, but it's no longer useful because it serves self-enjoyment, but serves to the end of adding values. The dream you identified during school life was due to the positive feedback loop provided by the environment, but the feedback loop changes when the the goal shifts. The goal is no longer about yourself only. 
- Making a difference is to adding values to others. 
- Influence itself can be really impactful on some else's life, and the influence is not distributed uniformly, it would be better to be influential yourself.  

To be influential, 
- The world is changing all the time *unpredictably*. Be responsive to the change in the world and anticipate change within yourself. Treat passion as an initial velocity vector that will be changed by the force field around you, i.e., the world. **Action precedes motivation**. His job as math visualization maker does not even exist when he graduated. 
- Focus on adding values to others; be aware that how much you can influence others and influence them. Kick off the feedback loop.
- Know what is possible now but not 10 years ago (play the game that matches the future unfolds, choose the right game to play ); follow opportunities but not dreams. 

To sum up, open to be influenced by and exert influence to others. 
It is certainly helpful for university new grads to prep them for the "reciprocal influence field" of the real life. It does not address the difference between this and "reciprocal gaslight field" is not clear.
