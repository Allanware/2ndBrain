# Harmehak talk
Cardiac disease modeling with Fibroblast: whether stem cell fibroblast is more like 
- Atrial, or 
- Ventricular 

Metabolic imaging for Atrial and Ventricular Fibroblast: 
FAD, NAD(P)H tao mean, redox ratio: umap does not cluster

TGFB (growth factor) activation 72 Hr: redox ratio and lifetime all goes up 
- what is the concentration of TGFB
- can you use different growth factors

### Goal
Co-culture cancel cell with fibroblast
