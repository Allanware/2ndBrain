# Juan
Molecules, proteins, DNA, cells, tissues 
Eye, Light Microscopy, Electron Microscopy 
Understand reactions to treatment, how cell organize and communicate each other

# Ron
AI to understand biotext (e.g. biomedical paper): use co-occurance model with labeled text thtt finetune the model  to qunderstand the relationship of concepts

# Anthony
protein engineering 
protein as factory for (new) chemicals that can be used pharmacy
use AI to take a candidate sequence change, predict protein function
- train on the (big) simulation data so that the model understands the biophysical
- use 100~ experimental measurements
