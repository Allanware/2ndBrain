## Experiment 2
### Plots

#### Pilot
- X: Contrast difference  
- Y: Probability of choosing the lower contrast one from the flower 2 color pair 
- Contrast is defined:
	- as hue distance in hue circle between flower 1 color and flower 2 color
	- as color distance in the CIELab color space between flower 1 color and the overlap color (f1 color on top vs f1 color on bottom)
		- the distance between f2a/f2b color and overlap color (calculated using the alpha blending formula)
