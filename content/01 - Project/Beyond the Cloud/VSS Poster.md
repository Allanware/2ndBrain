# Suggestions From the audience 
- The distribution of the unsorted condition is similar to the sorted condition. They suspected that by adding more perturbations, or changing to another distribution could increase the illusion
- In addition to manipulating hues, we could manipulate lightness and chroma. This makes sense to me because it could test our hypothesis of using continuous color metric (inner contrast, outer contrast)
- Cindy said she was curious to see the effect of using explicit encoding (bars go up if flower 1 is more popular than flower 2 in those categories and go down the other way), and the effect of number of bars. She was curious because previously she and her collegue only studied one bar (paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06773)
- Incorporate eye movement data: whether people spend more time looking at the "beyond the cloud" bars
- What would happen if people use line charts (a dot for each category and connect the dots by lines), like the one used as an example of superposition chart in Gleicher et al's paper, and one is sorted and the other unsorted. (paper: https://www.domoritz.de/papers/2023-LineBias-VIS.pdf)
- All others are questions about design guidelines.
