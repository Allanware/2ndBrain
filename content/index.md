My Second Brain in digital format. 

# Vault layout

Folders are the vertical axis of the indexing system of the files, and tags are content-related concepts that could fall into multiple folders (roughly perpendicular to the folder axis: the horizontal axis). Together, using both, I could identify a file entry in my vault matrix by specifying both the folder and the tag(s). 
## Folders: PARA method
### 01 - Project
On-going short-term projects with **deadline** and **end-goals**. One folder per project. E.g: a draft blog post I am working on. The projects are originated from Area and Resource, and once finished, should go to Archive; the area/resource where the project is related should link to it. 
### [area](02%20-%20Area/area.md)
Active, long-term spheres of activities I want to keep doing and have direct impact on me.
- [research](02%20-%20Area/research/research.md): progress on research areas. 
- [work](02%20-%20Area/work/work.md): 
- [blog](02%20-%20Area/blog/blog.md): published articles on personal [website/blog](https://allanware.github.io/). Each article is expected to link to several notes in the vault. Articles are more polished than the "crude" sources, and more of a "milestone-y" status: they reflect my relatively stable, up-to-date understanding on some subjects that my later notes should build upon and they are written clearly. A "5th thought" product. 
### [03 - Resource](03%20-%20Resource/resource.md)
Hobbies, interests, side-learning/projects that is not urgent and has no direct impacts on my life. 
- [journal](03%20-%20Resource/journal/journal.md): #impression #idea #random. "Rolling releases": more frequent, unstable updates on my understanding of something. 
	- events: [Full Calendar](01%20-%20Project/Obsidian/Documentation.md#[Full%20Calendar](https%20//davish.github.io/obsidian-full-calendar/)) helps automate the process of making event in a dedicated note with time metadata under this folder by dragging time frames on a calendar.
- [book](03%20-%20Resource/book/book.md): a note per book: #excerpt #summary #critique. 
- [film](03%20-%20Resource/film/film.md): film #impression #critique #excerpt #summary #learning
- [music](03%20-%20Resource/music/music.md): music and musical performances' #impression #critique #learning 
- [travel](03%20-%20Resource/travel/travel.md): travel #tutorial #map
- [recipe](03%20-%20Resource/recipe/recipe.md): #tutorial on dishes. 
- [productivity](03%20-%20Resource/productivity/productivity.md): increase general productivity. 

### 04 - Archive
Finished or inactive project, discontinued areas (e.g. research area that no longer pursue, switch work), and hobbies/interests no longer have.

# Change log
## Version 1.1 
To fix the issue where I have a projects folder and a projects tag, and to make things more actionable for me, I decide to adopt the PARA method to add a layer of hierarchy to my folder structure.
