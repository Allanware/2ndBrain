Articles/talks from others that offer advices on the PhD/research career. 
[Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/)
- He used the word "symbiosis" to describe the relationship b/w the student and the advisor. The kind of symbiosis is determined by the "**Axes of variation**" of the advisor.
	- levels of details
		- task-focused vs model-focused
		- hands-on vs hands-off
	- response rate, meeting frequency
	- funding/resources
	- degree of theory
- To echo back Andy's comment, the lab besides the advisor is really important (especially the postdoc and senior phds)
- on research topics, he noted the distinction between *inner loop* (problem solving) and *outer loop* 
	- Outer loop: where the most time are spent, figuring out what problems are worth solving and what problems are ripe for solving. You’re constantly imagining yourself solving hypothetical problems and asking yourself where that puts you, what it could unlock, or if anyone cares.
- what makes a problem interesting to work on: 
	- **A fertile ground**: during your PhD you will dive deeply into one area and your papers will very likely chain on top of each other to create a body of work (which becomes your thesis). Therefore, you should always be thinking several steps ahead when choosing a problem
	- **Plays to your adviser’s interests and strengths**: when choosing advisor, make sure your work can add new exciting cutting edge work slides to your advisor's “default talk” slide deck on their research that they give all the time.
	- **Be ambitious**: a 10x more important problem is at most 2-3x harder to achieve. In fact, in some cases a 10x harder problem may be easier to achieve:  because thinking 10x forces you out of the box, to confront the real limitations of an approach, to think from first principles, to change the strategy completely, to innovate.
		- first principle thinking (my explanation, not author's): research, or even life can be seen as a depth-first search, where we are building knowledge over assumptions, which is built up other knowledge/assumption. If we could not solve certain problem, it is like hitting a leaf-node in the search tree: we need to backtrack, by examining its parent assumptions. Instead of asking how, asking why. And so on so forth, until you hit a wall of very basic assumptions that are "unquestionable", at least for now.  
		- The [Neural Networks_Zero to Hero](../AI/Neural%20Networks_Zero%20to%20Hero.md) class he designed illustrates how to build backprop using first principle. 
	- , **but with an attack**: It’s not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.
	- **choose wisely**:  note that 5 years x 260 working days x 8 hours per day is 10,400 hours; if you believe Gladwell then a PhD is exactly the amount of time to become an expert). So imagine yourself 5 years later being a world expert in this area (the 10,000 hours will ensure that regardless of the academic impact of your work). Are these skills exciting or potentially valuable to your future endeavors?
	- **Resist the temptation of incremental work**: finding projects should ideally not include thoughts along the lines of “there’s this next logical step in the air that no one has done yet, let me do it”
	- his phd career: "I meandered around for 2 years stuck around the outer loop, finding something to dive into. Once it clicked for me what that was based on several heuristics, I dug in"
	- Think for yourself and from first principles. Do things others don’t do but should. Step off the treadmill that has been put before you.
- Tips for writing papers
	- **Review (both good and bad) papers**: be a reviewer to see them all. Join a journal club to see experienced researchers critique papers and get an impression for how your own papers will be analyzed by others. 
	- **Identify the single core contribution**, before you start writing. You have to argue that the thing is important, that it hasn’t been done before, and then you support its merit experimentally in controlled experiments. The entire paper is organized around this core contribution with surgical precision.
	- **The structure**: organize each of the paragraphs around a single concrete point stated on the first sentence that is then supported in the rest of the paragraph. Each point should be justified, motivated, explained. Why do you do X or Y? What are the alternatives? What have others done? It’s okay to say things like this is common (add citation if possible).
- Tips for give talks:
	- **The goal of a talk**: 
		1. Motivate the audience and convince them that the **problem** is important.
		2. Provide insight
		3. entertain => together, people will read your paper afterwards
	- Do's 
		- lots of pictures
		- make the talk actionable (provide demo)
		- develop a broader intellectual arch that your work is part of (the background)
		- develop it into a story
		- cite others! 
		- practice the talk
- Go to talks, even if one has to pay for themselves. 
	- ==It is said that there are three stages to a PhD. In the first stage you look at a related paper’s reference section and you haven’t read most of the papers. In the second stage you recognize all the papers. In the third stage you’ve shared a beer with all the first authors of all the papers.==
