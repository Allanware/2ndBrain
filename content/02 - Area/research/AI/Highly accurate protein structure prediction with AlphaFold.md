> [!Note] Paper writing tip: abstract
> Most of the words in the abstract are spent on *motivating* the problem. In contrast, there only a few describing their solution. In an application paper like this, method is not the center of the paper: if you can use a MLP to solve this problem, you will also be on Nature's cover. 

Each protein is made up by a sequence of amino acids (protein sequence, its primary structure), which dictates how it folds into a unique 3D structure (its tertiary structure) that determines its function.

> [!NOTE] Paper writing tip: result
> In presenting your result, it is better to mention a common object that people can easily relate to, rather than using numbers only. For example, compared with using "we have achieved 10% increase", using "atomic level accuracy" is not only more relatable, but also more "milstoney", b/c it is not a relative measure (which will render your work "incremental work") but a absolute measure.
